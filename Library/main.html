A library is a curated collection of sources of information and similar resources, selected by experts and made accessible to a 
defined community for reference or borrowing, often in a quiet environment conducive to study.
It provides physical or digital access to material, and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both. 
A library's collection can include books, periodicals, newspapers, manuscripts, films, maps, prints, 
documents, microform, CDs, cassettes, videotapes, DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, e-books, audiobooks, databases, and other formats. Libraries range widely in size up to millions of items. In Latin and Greek, the idea of a bookcase is 
represented by Bibliotheca and Bibliothēkē (Greek: βιβλιοθήκη): derivatives of these mean library in many modern languages, e.g. French bibliothèque.

The academic library provides a quiet study space for students on campus; it may also provide group study space, such as meeting rooms.
 In North America, Europe, and other parts of the world, academic libraries are becoming increasingly digitally oriented. 
 The library provides a "gateway" for students and researchers to access various resources, both print/physical and digital.
 Academic institutions are subscribing to electronic journals databases, providing research and scholarly writing software,
 and usually provide computer workstations or computer labs for students to access journals, library search databases and portals, 
 institutional electronic resources, Internet access, and course- or task-related software (i.e. word processing and spreadsheet software).
 Some academic libraries take on new roles, for instance, acting as an electronic repository for institutional scholarly research and academic knowledge, such as the collection and curation of digital copies of students' theses and dissertations.
 Moreover, academic libraries are increasingly acting as publishers on their own on a not-for-profit basis,
 especially in the form of fully Open Access institutional publishers

Public library advocacy is support given to a public library for its financial and philosophical goals or needs.
 Most often this takes the form of monetary or material donations or campaigning to the institutions which oversee the library, 
 sometimes by advocacy groups such as Friends of Libraries and community members.
